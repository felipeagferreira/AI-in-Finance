# Bankruptcy Prediction


The goal of this project is to design and develop machine learning models for corporate bankruptcy prediction 2 years into the future using the data from a dataset. 
We try and implement certain machine learning models such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting Classifier, Naïve Bayes Classification.
We mention a step by step process of how we train the machine, test and validate the models with hyper parameter tuning.
